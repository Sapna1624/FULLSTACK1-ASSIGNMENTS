    <p><i>Cascading down furiously between the rubber and coffee plantations of Jorhat, the Kakochang Waterfalls are a magnificent wonder of nature. The main waterfall is located 13 km from the Bokakhat in Jorhat and attracts tourists in great numbers year-round. Apart from providing a refreshing retreat and a great subject for shutterbugs, this waterfall gives splendid views of the ruins of Numaligarh and lush green tea plantations. Located close to the Kaziranga National Park, Kakochang is among the must-visit points of interest if you are planning with Assam tourism.</i></p>
