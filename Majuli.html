    <h2 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Majuli Island</h2>
    <p>Majuli’s eye-warming naturescapes make it one of the top tourist places in Assam. It is the world’s largest riverine island as well as one of the most important Satras established by Sankardeva and Madhavdev. The Majuli islands are spread over an area of around 452 sq km and most of these get submerged underwater during the monsoons, leaving the bigger islands like Kamalabari, Auniati, and Garamur on the surface. This is why it’s best to visit this place in Guwahati in May. This is undoubtedly among the best places to visit in Assam. Apart from having remarkable natural beauty, Majuli is also a birdwatcher’s paradise. A holiday with Assam tourism is incomplete without seeing one of the most beautiful places to visit in Assam.</p>
